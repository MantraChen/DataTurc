# 📘 Algorithm Problem Solving Repository  
**Based on MSYS2 MinGW64 Environment**

## 📌 Overview

This repository is a **public algorithm problem-solving library** built and tested under the **MSYS2 MinGW64 terminal environment**.  
It focuses on providing **clear solution logic and problem-solving ideas**, rather than serving as a plug-and-play answer set.

The main purpose of this project is **learning, discussion, and reference**.

### 📂 `problems/`
- Contains **actual implementations** of problem solutions  
- Problems are organized by **source platform**  
- Each directory corresponds to a specific problem

### 📂 `Pseudocode/`
- Contains **language-agnostic pseudocode**  
- Directory structure **mirrors** `problems/`  
- Focuses on explaining **algorithm design and logic flow**

---

## 🛠 Environment

- **Operating System**: Windows  
- **Toolchain**: MSYS2  
- **Terminal**: MinGW64  
- **Compiler**: GCC (MinGW-w64)

All solutions are written and tested under this environment unless otherwise stated.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Clarify **problem-solving strategies**
- Demonstrate **algorithmic thinking**
- Serve as a **reference**, not a direct submission source
- Encourage **independent re-implementation**
